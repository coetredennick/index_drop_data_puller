Comprehensive Analysis of the S&P 500 Market Drop Analyzer
Overview
The S&P 500 Market Drop Analyzer is a sophisticated data analytics platform designed to provide in-depth analysis of significant market corrections in the S&P 500 index. It combines historical data analysis, technical indicators, interactive visualizations, and machine learning to help users understand market behavior during and after significant drop events.

Core Architecture
Data Pipeline and Processing
Data Acquisition:

Utilizes the yfinance library to fetch historical S&P 500 data directly from Yahoo Finance with ticker "^GSPC"
Configurable time periods from 1950 to present
Performs automatic data cleaning to handle missing values and adjust for splits/dividends
Technical Indicator Calculation:

Implements a comprehensive suite of technical indicators using the pandas_ta library
Key indicators include:
Relative Strength Index (RSI_14)
Stochastic Oscillator (STOCHk_14_3_3)
Bollinger Band Position (BBP_20_2)
MACD Histogram (MACDh_12_26_9)
Average True Range as percentage (ATR_Pct)
Volume measurements and comparisons (Volume_Ratio, Avg_Vol_50)
Event Detection Algorithm:

Two specialized algorithms for identifying market correction events:
Single-day drop detection: Identifies days where the market fell by more than a user-defined threshold
Consecutive-day drop detection: Identifies sequences of consecutive days where EACH day fell by more than the threshold
Enhanced with comprehensive pattern recognition for drop event characterization
